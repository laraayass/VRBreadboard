The setup of the application is made in a way such that the breadboard is placed on one of the lab tables, with 3 buttons: -The Grab button which enables us to grab an integrated circuit (IC) and place it on the breadboard -The Add-Wire button which enables us to connect 2 pins -The Remove-Wire button which enables us to delete a connection between 2 pins

To build any circuit using this virtual breadboard, we have to:

Gaze at the Grab button then at the desired IC to get it
Gaze at the place we want to set our IC on
Once set up, we now move to the IC connections: Pin 7 should be connected to ground and pin 14 to VCC (as per the IC datasheet)

example: To connect pin 7 to ground, we gaze at the Add-Wire button, then at pin 7, and finally at the ground connection

The remaining connections are made depending on the given function to be implemented.
